# What's New in 1.15.1

*Released: January 22, 2026*

## 🔒 Security Improvements

- **Better Logging**: The library now uses a consistent logging system instead of
  writing directly to the console. This means cleaner output and no accidental
  information leakage in production environments.

## 📚 Documentation Updates

- **Concurrency Warning**: Added documentation about LRUCache limitations in
  high-concurrency async scenarios, with recommended alternatives for heavy usage.
